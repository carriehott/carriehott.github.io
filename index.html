        <p>Carrie Hott is an interdisciplinary artist and educator based in Oakland, California.</p>
        <p> Her research and projects are usually focused on technological systems. She is curious about how different forms of technology mediate our experiences on a daily basis, and how these systems came to exist in their present forms. More specifically, she is captivated by what provides a sense of comfort and security, or keeps us working and productive, or entertained, all while quietly mediating all of my surroundings and experiences, often in very subtle and insidious ways.</p> 
        <p>Her research based practice began ten years ago from a project about the history of artificial lighting, which grew out of a study of lamp oil and the relationship between humans and whales. This iterative research process, which can be drawn from a text, a dissection of a smart object, or a visit to power plant, for example, deeply informs what she makes and how she makes it. She creates multi-media installations that incorporate sound or video into sculptural settings. She also regularly make books and prints, or organizes free form group classes. Frequently, all of these forms are present in one project, providing multiple layers of experience or entry points into a subject.</p>
       <p>Some places that her work has been supported by include: <a href="https://artadia.org/artist/carrie-hott/" target="_blank">Artadia</a>, <a href="https://ybca.org/artist/carrie-hott/" target="_blank">Yerba Buena Center for the Arts</a>, <a href="https://www.recology.com/recology_artist/carrie-hott/" target="_blank">Recology San Francisco</a>, <a href="https://www.headlands.org/the-key-room/about/" target="_blank">Headlands Center for the Arts</a>,<a href="https://betalocal.org/the-harbor/carrie-hott-eeuu/" target="_blank">Beta-Local</a>,<a href="https://mcam.mills.edu/about/api-past.php" target="_blank"> Mills College Art Museum</a>, and <a href="https://www.thelab.org/" target="_blank">The Lab.</a></p>
       <p>She is currently working on a long term project about the web with <a href="https://www.thelab.org/" target="_blank">The Lab.</a></p>
      <p>In addition to her studio practice, she is an educator, curator, etc. She is currently on the board at Headlands Center for the Arts. And she teaches in the Design Program at University of San Francisco.</p>
      <p>She received her BFA from Arizona State University in 2003 and her MFA from the San Francisco Art Institute in 2007.</p>
